# Flight Path Adjustment

## Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - **Flight Paths**: Predefined list of flight paths, each consisting of a series of points.
   
2. **Intersection Detection**:
   - **Line Segment Intersection**: Implements an algorithm to check if two line segments intersect.
   - **Orientation and On-Segment Checks**: Uses orientation tests and segment containment checks to determine intersections.

3. **Path Adjustment**:
   - **Basic Adjustment**: Shifts the coordinates of intersecting paths to resolve conflicts. This approach serves as a placeholder for more advanced resolution methods.
